title: Destination Metis: The Journey into Data Science. 
---
## Prelude
Mid-year last year saw me looking at ways of improving my satisfaction from my job. There were always unanswered questions that required processing of data to draw some conclusion. Excel quickly reached its limitations. We were asked to reach out to the “Data Science” team for help. There were also a number of initiatives that were organization wide that aimed to develop strategies from answers to complex questions. The projects were all “Data Science” projects. 

I was intrigued enough that I started to look into this domain. I quickly realized that formalized instruction would be invaluable. I worked hard, studied about stuff long forgotten - Linear Algebra, probability and statistics and was accepted into the program at Metis. I thought I had reached my goal — my destination. 

## Metis - After acceptance
I received all my pre-work and that is when I realized that the destination was still about 30 odd days and several challenges away. I spent the holidays working through it and thought once again — I’ve reached my destination. 

To get to a destination one needs - focus, dedicated and motivated instructors, a stellar support structure that includes everything from basic office management to well developed material, and well designed study material and most importantly -  journey men who are equally motivated but bring unique skills and experiences for the road ahead.  

## Week 1 
I am now through week 1. I have realized that my destination is actually the beginning of a long journey into data science. Looking at all the activity in the center, the constant flow of alumni and company presentations, I think I have all of what is required for the journey as far as I would like it to take it. The destination is elusive as the space is evolving and coming to the center of several large decisions in everything from politics (2017 elections showed how much the space needs to mature) to medicine, education and finance. 

### Challenge 1

The first challenge put a few of us into a team and we were asked to find out how the best subway stations to hand out fliers for a specific event. We mined turnstile data from the subway system. First off, I did not know that this data existed! and second off all, it needed a significant amount of cleansing and standardization. My teammates were invaluable in their experience and without them I would be working on a solution that would have yielded odd results. We collectively then put together a significant amount of analysis that helped us decide an appropriate course of action. Given the data we had, we focused on arriving at a point in time that would yield the station with the largest number of prospective attendees at four hour intervals. Somewhere towards the midpoint of this project I realized the power of the various platforms that we were being made aware of. Python is easy to learn and was invaluable in all the cleanup. It then offered a way to streamline the analysis and plot the data but pandas could do all the work significantly faster. I’m learning to deal with data and come up with robust conclusive analysis. Additionally, we proposed a set of next steps that would need data that we did not have - for example if we had geolocation data on the stations we could figure out a set of moves wasting minimal time and hit stations that would collectively yield the largest number of prospective attendees for our event. To summarize, at first look, the data was truly rudimentary - station names, number of entries and exits from the turnstiles but the tools of the data science trade helped us transform the data into invaluable information. 

## Concluding Comment
I’ve come across my first station stop on my long journey - I’ve had tremendous satisfaction from this experience and I am now looking forward to the next few weeks.
